                        The issue our team is addressing covers a broad topic of social media usage. All of our advocacy posts relate back to social media and 
                        the users. The issues we discuss are: usage and its affects on society, impacts that social media holds over users, and political 
                        censorship on social media. The changes we are advocating for are: lower usage, not letting social media affect their self worth, and 
                        freedom of speech on platforms. Readers can find Instagram and TikTok posts in our section, creating a collection of social media posts 
                        to advocate for change that our audience can find easy to read and understand.

                            <em>This twitter post will demonstrate visuals and wordings on how social 
                            media usage has become such a huge part of user's daily routine. 
                            Severe amount of usage has caused some negative and positive habits 
                            within them which has been a cause for their daily habits around other 
                            individuals. Which is where I come in to open the user's eyes and see 
                            how using social media can really have an affect on their behaviors 
                            without realizing how much of an affect it has caused them.</em>

                            This TikTok uses movie clips to show common unhealthy patterns that are seen in 
                            modern relationships, showing patterns like: manipulation, ghosting, non-exclusivity, no effort, cheating, hookup culture, etc. Then after showing these clips 
                            it transitions to movie clips that show what healthy, supportive, effort, and 
                            genuine love in relationships. The difference in these clips show that although 
                            social media connects people it weakens relationships with unhealthy patterns 
                            and loss of genuine relationships. The TikToks message is supposed to show what 
                            authentic relationships look like when the partners are present, honest, and 
                            connected to eachother.

                            Censorship affects us wether we think it does or not, there are ways to fight back however. 
                            In this instagram post style slideshow, it goes over censorship on social media. The post 
                            covers what censorship is, how to fight back, and why acknowledging censorship is so 
                            important.
