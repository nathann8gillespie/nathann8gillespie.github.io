                                Alois Alzheimer reported a disease similar to Senile Dementia in 1906 in a 50-year-old 
                                woman and had a patient named Auguste D. Later, Alzheimer's disease has been around 
                                for over 100 years and there is still no effective treatment or cure. There is also no 
                                early diagnosis or an easy way to tell if someone has the disease or not.

                                Currently, there are over 7 million Americans living with Alzheimer's Disease 
                                and that number is going to double by 2050. The disease is more likely to occur in 
                                women than in men: 1 in 5 women and 1 in 10 men. The disease is also the 6th 
                                leading cause of death around the world killing over 114,020 people in a population 
                                of 334,914,895 people.

                                Healthcare clinics should prioritize testing illnesses before prescribing antibiotics in cases where the illness is 
                                likely bacterial. Researchers at the University of New Jersey recommend "test and treat" 
                                prescription of antibiotics as a BMJ study that found that using quick c-reactive protein tests greatly reduced 'over 
                                prescription of potentially dying antibiotics'. "Test to cure" prescriptions are essential.

                                For uncomplicated cases that do not clearly require immediate antibiotics, clinics should opt to using delayed 
                                prescriptions or "Watchman Waiting". Doctors found that delaying prescriptions was found to maintain similar patient 
                                satisfaction and recovery rates while reducing the overall prescription of antibiotics.

                                Clinics should monitor and reflect on their own prescription rates and compare themselves with guidelines and other 
                                clinics. Providing "feedback" was highlighted in a BMJ study and colleagues may found that giving a small step
